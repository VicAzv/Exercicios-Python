#Create an initials.py program that displays your initials in block letters.

#First, start the program with a comment that says a fun fact about yourself.

#Then, create your block letters with your initials.

#For example, if your name is Dua Lipa, your initials would be D and L, and your block letters would look like this:

# My initials are V and A
print("V   V   A  ")
print("V   V  A A ")
print("V   V A   A")
print("V   V AAAAA")
print("V   V A   A")
print(" V V  A   A")
print("  V   A   A")
